MPC Report:
	-Theory
		-Process Description
			Describe the problem that needs to be solved
			How is it going to be solved
		
		-Mathematical models
		
		-Model constraints
		
	-Methods
		-Open Loop simulation in Matlab
			-How is open loop simulation used on Oil well drilling?
			 *Need to split up Simulink model or visualize model from Model IO
			-What can Open loop simulation tell us about the system?
			
		
		-Non-Linear MPC
			-How is Non-Linear MPC used for controlling Pipe connections?
				
			-Objective function
				-Which parts of the system needs to be balanced against each other
				-How is this formulated into a cost function
			-Constraints
				-Why are constraints needed for this system? WHich physical limitations are there?
				-What are the inequality constraints? Which ones comes from task description, 7
					and which ones are deduced from task description.
				-What are the equality constraints? Whats their origin?
			
			-Optimization problem reduction
