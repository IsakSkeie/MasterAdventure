	-Transport of oil from wellbore tol the topside seperator
	-Models give information about uncertainty
	-Using classical determenistic material, and momentum balance principle
	-Model uncertaintyto be analyzed
	
	
	-Submersible pumps are used, to increase pressure
	-Use ideal gas law for liquid, make expression for gas density
	-isothermal compressanility, coefficient of thermal expansion
	-relate density to pressure
	-Dynamic viscosity? Kinematic viscosity
	-Relationship between production, reservoir pressure and heel pressure
