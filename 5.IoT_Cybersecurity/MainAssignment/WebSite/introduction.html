        <h1>Internet of things and Raspberry Pi</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Through the development of a temperature- and alarm-system.          
            A range of aspects within the IoT environment is explored.          
            Temperature measurements are to be sent to a RPI, where an          
            alarm system reacts to the incoming live temperature readings.      
            The alarm system includes an embedded interface for the RPI for     
            operators through LEDS and buttons connected to the GPIO of the RPI. 
            The data produced from the alarm system is then forwarded to        
            a database as well as a cloud-based data visualization service.     
            The data is subsequently analyzed. Developing an alarm system       
            and establishing the necessary data flow explores the potential    
            of several IoT technologies. The RPI sits at the core, through      
            the GPIO’s of the RPI, the possibilities of sensor data collection  
            and embedded interfacing is shown. The RPI is also the center for   
            all the data management, components like MQTT, databases and REST   
            API is used on the RPI, showing both the power of the RPI as well   
            as the utility of these protocols. The provided system              
            specification asks for the RPI only to be used for data                 
            collection, with the server components residing on the PC.          
            For a solution that’s more suitable to production, and to utilize   
            more of the RPI’s potential. Both the server components,            
            the database and the MQTT broker are running on the RPI.            
            Additionally, an ESP32 is used as an ADC. An ESP32 is a microcontroller 
            with built-in Wi-Fi. This enables the temperature reading to be     
            measured remotely and increasing the potential for scaling.         
            Being much more aligned with the IoT mindset and displaying more    
            of the capabilities of protocols like MQTT.
