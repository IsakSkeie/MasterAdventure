        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Through the development of a temperature- and alarm-system.          <br>
            A range of aspects within the IoT environment is explored.          <br>
            Temperature measurements are to be sent to a RPI, where an          <br>
            alarm system reacts to the incoming live temperature readings.      <br>
            The alarm system includes an embedded interface for the RPI for     <br>
            operators through LEDS and buttons connected to the GPIO of the RPI. <br>
            The data produced from the alarm system is then forwarded to        <br>
            a database as well as a cloud-based data visualization service.     <br>
            The data is subsequently analyzed. Developing an alarm system       <br>
            and establishing the necessary data flow explores the potential     <br>
            of several IoT technologies. The RPI sits at the core, through      <br>
            the GPIO’s of the RPI, the possibilities of sensor data collection  <br>
            and embedded interfacing is shown. The RPI is also the center for   <br>
            all the data management, components like MQTT, databases and REST   <br>
            API is used on the RPI, showing both the power of the RPI as well   <br>
            as the utility of these protocols. The provided system              <br>
            specification asks for the RPI only to be used for data             <br>    
            collection, with the server components residing on the PC.          <br>
            For a solution that’s more suitable to production, and to utilize   <br>
            more of the RPI’s potential. Both the server components,            <br>
            the database and the MQTT broker are running on the RPI.            <br>
            Additionally, an ESP32 is used as an ADC. An ESP32 is a microcontroller <br>
            with built-in Wi-Fi. This enables the temperature reading to be     <br>
            measured remotely and increasing the potential for scaling.         <br>
            Being much more aligned with the IoT mindset and displaying more    <br>
            of the capabilities of protocols like MQTT.                         <br>
