        <h3>Temperature readings</h3>
        <p>
            For temperature data, there’s two ways of measuring the data, and three ways 
            of transmitting the data. Looking first at the two different ways of measuring. 
            Both the thermistor and the DS18B20 are satisfactory. They showed a temperature 
            not far from each other around room temperature, and had a steady realistic 
            increase when heated up by pressing them between two fingers. Without having a 
            control value to compare them to, it’s hard to make any assumptions of which one 
            where the most accurate. But with the thermistor readings being based on the chosen 
            electrical components and the measured voltage scaling in the code. It’s reasonable 
            to assume that the digital temperature sensor is more accurate, as well as more linear. 
            Although the digital temperature sensor appears more accurate, there’s also the 
            transmitting method which must be taken into account. Using 1-wire is an easy method 
            for digital data transfer but is limited in its scalability. The same applies to data 
            transmission over Serial. A bit more cumbersome to set up the correct messaging 
            encoding/decoding, to make it result in usable floats. But not very scalable. Using 
            MQTT on the other hand, was with the MQTT broker the easiest way to transfer the temperature 
            data, and by far the most scalable solution.

        <h3>Alarm Handling</h3>
        <p>
            The Alarm system fulfills its purpose to easily interact with the RPI as well as 
            showing off the customizable capabilities provided by the RPI’s GPIO. The distinction between an 
            active and an unacknowledged inactive alarm is clear in the illuminating degree of the LED. 
            The button also works as intended for acknowledging the alarm.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Handling</h3>
        <p>
            Data handling consists of two parts, the first one being the transmitting of data,
            and the other being the storing of data. The transmission is done locally with MQTT. 
            The data is easily published and subscribed to through the broker running on the RPI. 
            With a wide range of IoT devices supporting the protocol, like the esp32 running a C++ program. 
            The other way data is being transmitted is with REST API to the cloud. A widespread protocol working 
            safely without problems. For data storage the database Postgres has been set up. 
            Data is successfully being stored and used by other applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Analysis and visualization</h3>
        <p>
            The temperature data is mainly visualized through ThingSpeak. 
            This works as intended and the accessibility of the data is greatly improved. 
            The use of REST API made it easy to post the data, albeit with a low resolution. 
            For some instances a higher resolution might be necessary. The process of analyzing 
            the data is both simple and streamlined. The database querying makes the analysis 
            process easy to adapt to other datasets and other systems. The data analysis script 
            also provides an useful bar graph clearly illustrating the different statistics like 
            mean, median, upper and lower percentiles.
