        <h3>Temperature Readings</h3>
        <p>
            The procedure of sending temperature data over MQTT proved to be a good solution,
            with an improved scalability and accessibility over physical wiring the temperature 
            sensors. With the digital temperature sensor DS18B20 established as the preferred temperature 
            sensor, it should have been connected to the esp32, removing the initial necessity of an ADC, 
            but maintain the benefits of using MQTT. Before sending the temperature system to production. 
            Scaling the system should be tested. With the RPI subscribing to several topics, for different data sources.
        </p>

        <h3>Alarm Handling</h3>
        <p>
            The specified way of handling the alarms is a rather crude approach, only highlighting the use 
            of GPIO pins on the RPI. A more intuitive and accessible solution would have been to host a webpage 
            on the RPI, with extended functionality based on the LED and button. With a webpage for alarm handling,
             it would also be possible to incorporate the data visualization and analysis. The data will in this case 
             only be accessible locally, but all the features specified in the task description would be in one place.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Handling</h3>
        <p>
            Evaluating data handling in the system, there’s two things to consider. The accessibility of the data, 
            and the protection of the data. Sending and receiving the data is done through well-established protocols like MQTT, 
            serial and REST API. The data transfer through MQTT could have been more structured. Using topics to sort the data. 
            It could be sorted by sensor type, sensor location etc. Making the specific data points more accessible once the system is scaled. 
            Protecting the data must be handled both in the communication protocol level, as well as for the database. 
            MQTT has a well established system for handling its cyber security, with credentials, tokens, and topic related 
            access. For development, the broker was set up without any security, focusing rather on showing that it works. 
            But if this were to be pushed into production, the brokers security measures would need to be configured. For the REST API connection, 
            there’s already a token in place, supplied by the cloud service, making the connection secure. The REST API connection 
            could be further improved by encrypting the token in the script where it is used. For database access, 
            login credentials were set up from the start. For this system it seems like a sufficiently precautious measure.
             But if the system was to be scaled up. One could consider setting up different users with specific access.
