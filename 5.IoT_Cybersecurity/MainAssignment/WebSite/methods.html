        <h3>Hardware Overview</h3>
        <p>In setting up the temperature management system,                 <br>
            several hardware components are needed. Both for development,   <br>
            but also for further production of the project. All of the      <br>
            hardware components are listed in Table #. The RPI hosts        <br>
            the MQTT broker, the relational database, the temperature       <br>
            handling, as well as the alarm handling. The ESP32 functions     <br>
            as an Analog to Digital converter, transmitting temperature     <br>
            readings to the RPI, either through the Serial protocol over    <br>
            USB, or through the MQTT broker. The remaining hardware         <br>
            components are quite simple and self-explanatory in their table rows. </p>
